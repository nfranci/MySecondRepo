This is my second doc into repo. Trying commands from git bash


gti branch 
git branch myNewBranch
Added a new file in windows
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master | since the origin was not specified this creatd a new origin for this branch
git remote add  https://github.com/nfranci/MySecondRepo.git | this failed becoz of last step.

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/nfranci/MySecondRepo.git | this pointed the remote url to mySecondRepo
git push -u origin master | pushed the changes to myNewBranch as separate branch in origin

adding a new line to the doc. making anoother change now.
